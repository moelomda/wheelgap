# Recipes

Practical ways to check your project's dependencies with wheelgap.

## Multi-arch images

Check both architectures before building an image for AMD64 and ARM64. This
example uses `uv.lock` and a `Dockerfile` whose final stage is based on a
supported Python image, such as `FROM python:3.13-slim-bookworm`, without
pinning it to one architecture. Run it from the build context directory:

```bash
wheelgap uv.lock --dockerfile Dockerfile -t linux/amd64,linux/arm64 &&
  docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
    --output type=oci,dest=app.tar .
```

- The same Docker platform names select both architectures in wheelgap and
  Buildx. `--dockerfile` supplies the Python version and libc settings from
  the final image; for a supported Alpine image it checks musl wheels instead.
- `&&` starts the build only if the check succeeds. With the default failure
  policy, a source build, missing distribution or unknown result on either
  architecture stops it. Input errors stop it too.
- Use a Buildx builder configured for both platforms and OCI export, such as
  the `docker-container` builder in Docker's
  [multi-platform guide](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/).
  The [OCI output](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/buildx/build/#oci)
  writes both image variants to `app.tar`.

The check reports wheel availability for the lockfile, not whether the image
build or application will succeed. Match any dependency-selection flags to
what your Dockerfile installs.

## Free-threading readiness

List packages that need a source build, have no usable distribution, or couldn't
be looked up on at least one common native platform for free-threaded Python 3.14. With `wheelgap`
and `jq` installed, run this in your project directory:

```bash
set -o pipefail
wheelgap -p 3.14t -t all --json --exit-zero \
  | jq -r '.packages[] | select([.results[]] | any(. == "source" or . == "missing" or . == "unknown")) | .name'
```

- `-p 3.14t` checks free-threaded Python; you do not need to run wheelgap on that
  interpreter.
- `-t all` checks the eight common native platforms. Replace it with the targets
  you deploy to if you only need a subset.
- `--exit-zero` keeps gaps from failing this informational command.
  Bash's `pipefail` still exposes input errors from wheelgap.
- The filter reads the **values** of `results`, so it keeps working if you add
  more Pythons (for example `-p 3.13,3.14t`), though the list then includes gaps
  on those Pythons too.

Sample output (from wheelgap's own `tests/fixtures/uvproj` test project):

```text
fastlib
nativeext
puresdist
winonly
```

This reports wheel availability, not whether a package is safe to use without
the GIL. A package listed because its result is `unknown` couldn't be looked up;
its `error` field in the JSON says why.
